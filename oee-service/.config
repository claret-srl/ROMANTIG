[MACHINE_STATES]
# Please provide the machine states to be considered as a successful conclusion of the production cycle:
# syntax: State 01,State 02,...,State nn
ENDS_GOOD=In Placing

# Please provide the machine states to be considered as a bad conclusion of the production cycle:
# syntax: State 01,State 02,...,State nn
ENDS_BAD=In Trashing

# Please provide the machine states to be considered as productive times
# syntax: State 01,State 02,...,State nn
TIMES_UP=In Picking,In Welding,In QC,In Placing

# Please provide the machine states to be considered as downtime:
# syntax: State 01,State 02,...,State nn
TIMES_DOWN=Idle,In Reworking,In QC from rework,In Trashing,Timeout

# (!) Any other state provided by the OP-UA server
# (!) will be interpreted as a states in which production has not been planned
# (!) for these reason, in these extra states, availability will not decrease
# (!) unlike in TIMES_DOWN states.
# (!) e.g. in the themo server an Offline state is fired each 10 cycle.

[TIMING]
# Please provide the timestep to group OEE stats:
# syntax: <quantity> <[second|minute|hour|day|week|month|year]>
TIME_STEP=1 minutes

# Please provide the ideal duration of the process.
# syntax: <quantity> <[second|minute|hour|day|week|month|year]> 
TIME_IDEAL=5 seconds

# Please provide a date and time to be consider as starting point of the stats collected:
# syntax: <YYYY-MM-DD>
START_DATE=2023-01-01

# syntax: <hh-mm-ss>
START_TIME=08:00:00

### Availability
```math
Availability = \frac{Run Time}{Planned Production Time}
```
### Run Time
```math
{Run Time} = {Planned Production Time} − {Stop Time}
```
### Performance
```math
{Performance} = \frac{\frac{Total Run Time}{Planned Production Time}}{Ideal Run Rate}
```
### Quality
```math
Quality =\frac{Good Count}{Total Count}
```
### OEE
```math
{OEE} = {Availability} × {Performance} × {Quality}
```
